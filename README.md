If there are multiple results from the queries on a series name or season/episode it will prompt the user in the console to select only one of the options.

Returns a magnet link.

Query syntax
------------
Eztv-query tries to give you a human friendly free text query syntax.

Etv-query will try to figure out what specific season and episode you are looking for by matching any [episode syntax](https://github.com/Munter/episode#supported-syntaxes) in your query string. In addition, having `latest` anywhere in your query will automatically default to the latest aired episode.

The rest of the query string is passed on to find the series in question.

Examples:

`eztv-query big`: Lists all possible matching shows and queries user to select one. Then queries user to select an episode. Returns the selected episode.

`eztv-query downton abbey`: Lists all seasons and episodes and queries the user to select one. Returns the selected episode.

`eztv-query game of thrones season 5`: Lists all episodes in season 5 and queries the user to select one. Returns the selected episode.

`eztv-query west wing 5x10`: Returns season 5 episode 10.

`eztv-query latest big bang theory`: Returns the latest episode (highest season and episode number).
